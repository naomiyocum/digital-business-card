## General Info
This is my first solo project using React - view the deployed version [here](https://naomi-yocum-business-card.netlify.app/)! I created a digital business card with links to my socials and a brief about me section. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I also used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/use-with/react) for icons.

## Learning Goals
* Implement responsive design
* Build custom components
* Get familiar with JSX

## Technologies
* React.JS
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* VSCode
* Netlify

## Usage

To get this set up on your local machine:
- Fork then clone this project
- In your terminal:
```
cd digital-business-card
npm start
```
This will run the app in the development mode. If it doesn't open automatically, go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your broswer.
